# (Prosper Loan Data Exploration)
## by (Alfred BobManuel)


## Dataset
> The dataset contains 113,937 rows and 81 columns that depict issued loan, including the features namely: 
loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, BorrowerApr, StatedMonthlyIncome amongst others. the data set can be found here [Udacity](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv).


## Summary of Findings

> The main variable of interest was the BorrowerApr and i found out that it has a negative correlation with the LoanOrigninalAmount, when plotted against eachother at different sizes the borrowerApr has a large range of distribution, but there is a decrease in the BorrowerApr when the LoanOriginalAmount increases.
> With an extended loan term, the loan amount also grows. Additionally, I discovered that borrowers with higher ratings earn more each month and take out larger loans. Compared to part-time, retired, and unemployed borrowers, working, self-employed, and full-time borrowers have higher monthly income and loan amounts. The elements of the Prosper rating feature and categorical terms interact. There are proportionally more 60-month loans with B and C grades. Borrowers with HR ratings can only get loans for 36 months. There is a relationship between term and rating and loan amount. Better Prosper ratings result in higher loan amounts for all three terms and bigger loan amount increases between periods.


## Key Insights for Presentation 

> For the key insight i will present my analysis from each stage of the exploratio, i will look at the number of houses people with different occuptation own, also the prosperscore distribution, states with the highest amount of loans, borrowersApr against Term, and i also investigated the effect of rating on ralationship between APR and loan amount, as well as the effect of rating on relationship between borrower APR and term.
